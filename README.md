# Statistical Learning Project: Weather Prediction

This Statistical Learning Project was prepared by:
1. Lang Kah Chun
2. Sun Qi Yang
3. Toh Weng Jee

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a model to predict weather conditions accurately.

## Methodology

1. **Regression Model**: Experimented with regression models to build the predictive model.
2. **Sequence Analysis Model**: Developed a sequence analysis model for predicting future weather conditions.

## Data Collection

The dataset was obtained from an open-source website and contains a wide range of hourly weather data. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/weatherarchive/basel_switzerland_2661604).

## Summary

We successfully developed a sequence analysis model that accurately predicts future weather conditions, demonstrating the practical application of statistical learning techniques in weather prediction.
